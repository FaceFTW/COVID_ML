# COVID Machine Learning Experiments

Some experiments with various machine learning models to predict COVID-19 Deaths in the US. This was a part of a machine learning course I took at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.

THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS. I PLAN ON CLEANING UP THIS STUFF IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

## Tools Used

The main notebook is actually a .NET Interactive/Polyglot Notebook which uses the Juptyer IRkernel to run R code. Separate C# and R scripts are provided as well. TODO - add devcontainer for VS Code.
